	I hope your own grace will keep you where you are,
	though there were no further danger known but the

DIANA	You shall not need to fear me.

Widow	I hope so.

	Look, here comes a pilgrim: I know she will lie at
	my house; thither they send one another: I'll
	question her. God save you, pilgrim! whither are you bound?

HELENA	To Saint Jaques le Grand.
	Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?
