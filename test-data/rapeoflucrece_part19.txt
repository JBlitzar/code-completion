And gazed for tidings in my eager eyes,
Fearing some hard news from the warlike band,
Where her beloved Collatinus lies.

Until her husband's welfare she did hear;
Whereat she smiled with so sweet a cheer,

Self-love had never drown'd him in the flood.

All orators are dumb when beauty pleadeth;
Poor wretches have remorse in poor abuses;
