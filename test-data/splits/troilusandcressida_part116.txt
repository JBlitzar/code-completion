PANDARUS	My niece is horribly in love with a thing you have,

HELEN	She shall have it, my lord, if it be not my lord Paris.

HELEN	Falling in, after falling out, may make them three.

PANDARUS	Come, come, I'll hear no more of this; I'll sing
	you a song now.

HELEN	Ay, ay, prithee now. By my troth, sweet lord, thou
	hast a fine forehead.

PANDARUS	Ay, you may, you may.
