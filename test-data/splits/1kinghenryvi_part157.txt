	While he, renowned noble gentleman,

	Alencon, Reignier, compass him about,
	And Talbot perisheth by your default.

LUCY	And York as fast upon your grace exclaims;
	Swearing that you withhold his levied host,
	Collected for this expedition.

	I owe him little duty, and less love;
	And take foul scorn to fawn on him by sending.

	Hath now entrapp'd the noble-minded Talbot:
	Never to England shall he bear his life;
