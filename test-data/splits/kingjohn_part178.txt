	Doth by the idle comments that it makes
	Foretell the ending of mortality.

PEMBROKE	His highness yet doth speak, and holds belief
	That, being brought into the open air,

	Doth he still rage?

	[Exit BIGOT]

PEMBROKE	He is more patient
	Than when you left him; even now he sung.

PRINCE HENRY	O vanity of sickness! fierce extremes
