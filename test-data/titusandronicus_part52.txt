	[To TAMORA]

	Madam, now shall ye see
	Our Roman hunting.

MARCUS ANDRONICUS	                  I have dogs, my lord,
	Will rouse the proudest panther in the chase,
	And climb the highest promontory top.

TITUS ANDRONICUS	And I have horse will follow where the game
	Makes way, and run like swallows o'er the plain.

DEMETRIUS	Chiron, we hunt not, we, with horse nor hound,
	But hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground.

	[Exeunt]
