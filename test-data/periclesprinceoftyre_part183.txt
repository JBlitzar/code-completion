	Shall we refresh us, sir, upon your shore,
	And give you gold for such provision
	As our intents will need?

LYSIMACHUS	Sir,
	With all my heart; and, when you come ashore,
	I have another suit.

PERICLES	You shall prevail,
	Were it to woo my daughter; for it seems
	You have been noble towards her.

LYSIMACHUS	Sir, lend me your arm.

PERICLES	Come, my Marina.

	[Exeunt]
