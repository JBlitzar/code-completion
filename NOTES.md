# code-completion

- 5 nov 2024
  - Just doing some research about code completion.
  - Current idea for data gathering: Scrape github but filter on the following criteria:
    - Repo with >100 stars
    - Only python code, the repo must contain mostly python code also
    - Small files: >100 bytes but <100 kb maybe? Paper did 100mb
  - Yes
