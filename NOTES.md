# code-completion

- 5 nov 2024
  - Just doing some research about code completion.
  - Current idea for data gathering: Scrape github but filter on the following criteria:
    - Repo with >100 stars
    - Only python code, the repo must contain mostly python code also
    - Small files: >100 bytes but <100 kb maybe? Paper did 100mb
  - Yes

- Take a break from transformers, do some scraping!
- See `scraping/`
- Github api requests, switch out PATs for higher ratelimits
- Scrape repos with the following criterion: >100 stars, python.
- Do in sections of months to get around the max 1000 results constraint
- So we have 30k of all python repositories since 2015
- Then scrape files, just .py files between 1 and 100 kb, using SHA to avoid reuse
