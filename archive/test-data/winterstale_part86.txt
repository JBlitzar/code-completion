	Which contradicts my accusation and
	The testimony on my part no other
	But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me

	Behold our human actions, as they do,
	I doubt not then but innocence shall make
	False accusation blush and tyranny
	Tremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,
	Who least will seem to do so, my past life
	Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,
	As I am now unhappy; which is more

	And play'd to take spectators. For behold me
