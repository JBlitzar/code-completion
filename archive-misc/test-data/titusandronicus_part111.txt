MARCUS ANDRONICUS	O, why should nature build so foul a den,
	Unless the gods delight in tragedies?

TITUS ANDRONICUS	Give signs, sweet girl, for here are none
	but friends,
	What Roman lord it was durst do the deed:
	Or slunk not Saturnine, as Tarquin erst,
	That left the camp to sin in Lucrece' bed?

MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Sit down, sweet niece: brother, sit down by me.
	Apollo, Pallas, Jove, or Mercury,
	Inspire me, that I may this treason find!
	My lord, look here: look here, Lavinia:
	This sandy plot is plain; guide, if thou canst
	This after me, when I have writ my name
	Without the help of any hand at all.

	[He writes his name with his staff, and guides it
	with feet and mouth]
