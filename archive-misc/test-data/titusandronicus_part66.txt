TAMORA	Farewell, my sons: see that you make her sure.
	Ne'er let my heart know merry cheer indeed,
	Till all the Andronici be made away.
	Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor,
	And let my spleenful sons this trull deflow'r.

	[Exit]

	[Re-enter AARON, with QUINTUS and MARTIUS]

AARON	Come on, my lords, the better foot before:
	Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit
	Where I espied the panther fast asleep.

QUINTUS	My sight is very dull, whate'er it bodes.

MARTIUS	And mine, I promise you; were't not for shame,
	Well could I leave our sport to sleep awhile.
