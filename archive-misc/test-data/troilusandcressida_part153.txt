	Ajax;' and he replies 'Thanks, Agamemnon.' What think

ACHILLES	Thou must be my ambassador to him, Thersites.

	valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector
	to come unarmed to my tent, and to procure
	safe-conduct for his person of the magnanimous
	and most illustrious six-or-seven-times-honoured
