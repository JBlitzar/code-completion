	That in himself which he spurs on his power
	To qualify in others: were he meal'd with that
	Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous;
	But this being so, he's just.

	The steeled gaoler is the friend of men.

	[Knocking within]

	That wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes.

	[Re-enter Provost]
