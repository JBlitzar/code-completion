DORCAS	We had the tune on't a month ago.

AUTOLYCUS	I can bear my part; you must know 'tis my

AUTOLYCUS	Get you hence, for I must go
	Where it fits not you to know.

DORCAS	     Whither?

MOPSA	                  O, whither?

DORCAS	Whither?

MOPSA	     It becomes thy oath full well,
	Thou to me thy secrets tell.
