ACT IV



SCENE II	Mytilene. A room in a brothel.


	[Enter Pandar, Bawd, and BOULT]

Pandar	Boult!

BOULT	Sir?

Pandar	Search the market narrowly; Mytilene is full of
	gallants. We lost too much money this mart by being
	too wenchless.

Bawd	We were never so much out of creatures. We have but
	poor three, and they can do no more than they can
