	And he that otherwise accounts of me,
	This sword shall prove he's honour's enemy.

SIMONIDES	No?
	Here comes my daughter, she can witness it.

PERICLES	Then, as you are as virtuous as fair,
	Resolve your angry father, if my tongue
	Did ere solicit, or my hand subscribe
	To any syllable that made love to you.

THAISA	Why, sir, say if you had,
	Who takes offence at that would make me glad?

SIMONIDES	Yea, mistress, are you so peremptory?

	[Aside]
