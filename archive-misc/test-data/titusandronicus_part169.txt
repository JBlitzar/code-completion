	Or else I'll call my brother back again,
	And cleave to no revenge but Lucius.

TAMORA	[Aside to her sons]  What say you, boys? will you
	bide with him,
	Whiles I go tell my lord the emperor
	How I have govern'd our determined jest?
	Yield to his humour, smooth and speak him fair,
	And tarry with him till I turn again.

TITUS ANDRONICUS	[Aside]  I know them all, though they suppose me mad,
	And will o'erreach them in their own devices:
	A pair of cursed hell-hounds and their dam!

DEMETRIUS	Madam, depart at pleasure; leave us here.

TAMORA	Farewell, Andronicus: Revenge now goes
	To lay a complot to betray thy foes.

TITUS ANDRONICUS	I know thou dost; and, sweet Revenge, farewell.
