	It were convenient you had such a devil:
	But welcome, as you are. What shall we do?

TAMORA	What wouldst thou have us do, Andronicus?

DEMETRIUS	Show me a murderer, I'll deal with him.

CHIRON	Show me a villain that hath done a rape,
	And I am sent to be revenged on him.

TAMORA	Show me a thousand that have done thee wrong,
	And I will be revenged on them all.

TITUS ANDRONICUS	Look round about the wicked streets of Rome;
	And when thou find'st a man that's like thyself.
	Good Murder, stab him; he's a murderer.
	Go thou with him; and when it is thy hap
	To find another that is like to thee,
	Good Rapine, stab him; he's a ravisher.
	Go thou with them; and in the emperor's court
