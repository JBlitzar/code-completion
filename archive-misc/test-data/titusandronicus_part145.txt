	Who threats, in course of this revenge, to do
	As much as ever Coriolanus did.

SATURNINUS	Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths?
	These tidings nip me, and I hang the head
	As flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms:
	Ay, now begin our sorrows to approach:
	'Tis he the common people love so much;
	Myself hath often over-heard them say,
	When I have walked like a private man,
	That Lucius' banishment was wrongfully,
	And they have wish'd that Lucius were their emperor.

TAMORA	Why should you fear? is not your city strong?

SATURNINUS	Ay, but the citizens favor Lucius,
	And will revolt from me to succor him.

TAMORA	King, be thy thoughts imperious, like thy name.
	Is the sun dimm'd, that gnats do fly in it?
