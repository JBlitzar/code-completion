	Our great competitor: from Alexandria
	This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes
	The lamps of night in revel; is not more man-like

	More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or
	Vouchsafed to think he had partners: you shall find there

	Evils enow to darken all his goodness:
	His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,

	Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,
	Than what he chooses.

	To give a kingdom for a mirth; to sit
	And keep the turn of tippling with a slave;
