DEMETRIUS	I'll broach the tadpole on my rapier's point:
	Nurse, give it me; my sword shall soon dispatch it.

AARON	Sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up.

	[Takes the Child from the Nurse, and draws]

	Stay, murderous villains! will you kill your brother?
	Now, by the burning tapers of the sky,
	That shone so brightly when this boy was got,
	He dies upon my scimitar's sharp point
	That touches this my first-born son and heir!
	I tell you, younglings, not Enceladus,
	With all his threatening band of Typhon's brood,
	Nor great Alcides, nor the god of war,
	Shall seize this prey out of his father's hands.
	What, what, ye sanguine, shallow-hearted boys!
	Ye white-limed walls! ye alehouse painted signs!
	Coal-black is better than another hue,
